        Leetcode is a free online platform where we can practice coding in multiple programming languages, but mainly I'll use Python as a main tool. The sole purpose of this repository is to keep track of my learning progress so I can come back and study. Also, by collecting my works on Github, I will become much more familiar with the Git concept, which might be useful in the future.
